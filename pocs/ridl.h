/**
 * The flags argument
 *     MAP_ANONYMOUS
 *         The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are
 *         initialized to zero.  The fd argument is ignored; however,
 *         some implementations require fd to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or
 *         MAP_ANON) is specified, and portable applications should
 *         ensure this.  The offset argument should be zero.  The use of
 *         MAP_ANONYMOUS in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is supported on
 *         Linux only since kernel 2.4.
 *     
 *     MAP_PRIVATE
 *         Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the
 *         mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the same
 *         file, and are not carried through to the underlying file.  It
 *         is unspecified whether changes made to the file after the
 *         mmap() call are visible in the mapped region.
 *     
 *     MAP_POPULATE (since Linux 2.5.46)
 *         Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping.  For a file
 *         mapping, this causes read-ahead on the file.  This will help
 *         to reduce blocking on page faults later.  MAP_POPULATE is sup‚Äê
 *         ported for private mappings only since Linux 2.6.23. 
 *     
 *     MAP_HUGETLB (since Linux 2.6.32)
 *         Allocate the mapping using "huge pages."  See the Linux kernel
 *         source file Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst for
 *         further information, as well as NOTES, below.

/**
 * mmap - map files or devices into memory
 *     #include <sys/mman.h>
 *     void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
 *                int fd, off_t offset);
 * 
 *     mmap() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the
 *     calling process.  The starting address for the new mapping is
 *     specified in addr.  The length argument specifies the length of the
 *     mapping (which must be greater than 0).
 * 
 *     If addr is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned) address
 *     at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable method of
 *     creating a new mapping.  If addr is not NULL, then the kernel takes
 *     it as a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel
 *     will pick a nearby page boundary (but always above or equal to the
 *     value specified by /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr) and attempt to create
 *     the mapping there.  If another mapping already exists there, the
 *     kernel picks a new address that may or may not depend on the hint.
 *     The address of the new mapping is returned as the result of the call.
 * 
 *     The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous mapping;
 *     see MAP_ANONYMOUS below), are initialized using length bytes starting
 *     at offset offset in the file (or other object) referred to by the
 *     file descriptor fd.  offset must be a multiple of the page size as
 *     returned by sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE).
 * 
 *     After the mmap() call has returned, the file descriptor, fd, can be
 *     closed immediately without invalidating the mapping.
 *
 *     The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the
 *     mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).  It
 *     is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following
 *     flags:
 * 
 *     PROT_EXEC  Pages may be executed.
 *     PROT_READ  Pages may be read.
 *     PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.
 *     PROT_NONE  Pages may not be accessed.
